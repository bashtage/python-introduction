# # `for` Loops
#
# This lesson covers:
#
# * for loops
# * Nested loops
#
#

# %%
# ## Problem: Basic For Loops
#
# Construct a for loop to sum the numbers between 1 and N for any N. A for loop
# that does nothing can be written:
#
# ```python
# n = 10
# for i in range(n):
#     pass
# ```
#

# ## Problem: Compute a compound return
# The compound return on a bond that pays interest annually at rate r is given
# by $cr_{t}=\prod_{i=1}^{T}(1+r)=(1+r)^{T}$. Use a for loop compute the total
# return for Â£100 invested today for $1,2,\ldots,10$ years. Store this variable
# in a 10 by 1 vector cr.
#

# %%


# %%
# ## Problem: Simulate a random walk
#
# (Pseudo) Normal random variables can be simulated using the command
# `np.random.standard_normal(shape)` where `shape` is a tuple (or a scalar)
# containing the dimensions of the desired random numbers. Simulate 100 normals
# in a 100 by 1 vector and name the result `e`. Initialize a vector `p`
# containing zeros using the function zeros. Add the 1st element of `e` to the
# first element of `p`. Use a for loop to simulate a process
# $y_{i}=y_{i-1}+e_{i}$. When finished plot the results using
#
# ```python
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# plt.rc('figure', figsize=(16,6))
#
# plt.plot(y)
# ```

# ## Problem: Nested Loops
#
# Begin by loading momentum data used in an earlier lesson. Compute a
# 22-day moving-window standard deviation for each of the columns. Store
# the value at the end of the window.
#
# When finished, make sure that `std_dev` is a `DataFrame` and
# plot the annualized percentage standard deviations using:
#
# ```python
# ann_std_dev = 100 * np.sqrt(252) * std_dev
# ann_std_dev.plot()
# ```

# %%
# Setup: Load the momentum data

import pandas as pd

momentum = pd.read_csv("data/momentum.csv", index_col="date", parse_dates=True)
momentum = momentum / 100  # Convert to numeric values from percentages

# ## Exercises
#
# ### Exercise
# 1. Simulate a 1000 by 10 matrix consisting of 10 standard random walks using
#    both nested loops and `np.cumsum`.
# 2. Plot the results.
#
# **Question to think about**
#
# If you rerun the code in this Exercise, do the results change? Why?
#
#
# ### Exercise: Compute Drawdowns
#
# Using the momentum data, compute the maximum drawdown over all
# 22-day consecutive periods defined as the smallest cumulative
# produce of the gross return (1+r) for 1, 2, .., 22 days.
#
# Finally, compute the mean drawdown for each of the portfolios.
