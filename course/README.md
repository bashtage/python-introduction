  used, except statsmodels, which is covered as it is used.
* `autumn` - The companion course that mirrors the MFE financial econometrics
  lectures in the autumn term (Michaelmas).
* `winter` - The companion course that mirrors the MFE financial econometrics
  lectures in the winter term (Hilary).
