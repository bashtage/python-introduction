# This is an example of a markdown cell.  You can use **bold**, _italics_, and
# `monospace` formatting.  You can also have code blocks.
#
# ```python
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)
# ```
#
# Markdown cells also support both inline math, $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$ or entire
# lines,
#
# $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right),$$
#
# using $\LaTeX$ code.
#
# You can also include tables,
#
# | Parameter | Value |
# |-----------|-------|
# | $\alpha$  | 0.05  |
# | $\beta$   | 0.90  |
