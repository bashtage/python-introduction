# ### Exercise 44
# Use the OLS function to estimate the coefficients of the Fama-French portfolios (monthly data) on the
# market, size and value factors. Include a constant in the regressions. Use only the four
# extremum portfolios – that is the 1-1, 1-5, 5-1 and 5-5 portfolios. Estimate the model with
# homoskedastic errors and with White's covariance estimator.

# ### Exercise 45
# Are the parameter standard errors similar using the two covariance estimators?
# If not, what does this mean?

# ### Exercise 46
